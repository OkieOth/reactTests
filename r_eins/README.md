This is a first react example based on a call of 

```bash
create-react-app r_eins
```

The project also integrates webpack for building a release and starting a hot reload 
development server.


After checkout install at first the needed dependencies

```bash
cd r_eins
npm install
```

Build a release
```bash
cd r_eins
npm run build:prod
```

Start development server
```bash
cd r_eins
npm run devserver
# open browser on http://localhost:8080/ manually
```
